## Creating & Modifying Icons

All UMI MVX assets are created using the free and open source vector graphics editor [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), which is recommended for creating new icons or modifying existing ones.

While other tools exist that are suitable for SVG editing, they often add custom elements to extend the limitatations of standard SVG format, so they are not recommended.

## Icon Names

Use of file names in line with the [FreeDesktop.Org Icon Naming Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) is encouraged for new icons. Failing that, when possible use generic file names and create symbolic links to the generic icon.

## Adding Icons

The UMI MVX icon set is a "universal" community icon set, which means it attempts to supply icons for many third-party applications (a "third-party" application is any application that is non-generic and has it's own branding, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Inkscape).

If you are a third-party developer would like to be cohesive with this icon set by providing a UMI MVX-styled icon in your app, don't hesistate to reach out for assistance, if need be.
